### Development

1. Clone this repo
2. Setup a local instance of Home Assistant, I prefer to use Docker for this
3. Install the [Bambu Lab Integration](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab)
4. Setup a docker-compose.yml file with the correct volume binds. My file as an example:
```yml 
version: "3.3"
services:
  hass:
    image: homeassistant/home-assistant:beta
    container_name: homeassistant
    restart: unless-stopped # To reboot the container when the host comes back up from restarts.
    ports:
      - 8123:8123
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ../custom/ha-bambulab-cards/dist
        target: /config/www/community/ha-bambulab-cards
      - ./hass_dev:/config
```
